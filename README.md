## 📝 **What is WebChat?**  
WebChat is an educational project created by me. I wanted to build something cool involving sockets, connections, etc., and I did!

**REMEMBER THAT THIS PROJECT IS SOLELY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES.  
IT IS UNOPTIMIZED, AND MANY AREAS COULD BENEFIT FROM BETTER SOLUTIONS. 😓**

## 🕵🏻 **How do I use it?**  
It's really simple. In this repository, you'll find the client you'll use to connect to the server (the server can be found in the *WebChatServer* repository).

**Step by step:**
- Download everything by clicking the green **"Code"** button, then download the ZIP file.
- Unzip it to any location you'd like.
- Run **index.html**.
- And that's it. Happy chatting! 🥳

## 🔧 **Known issues**  
There are a few known issues that I might fix in the future, but honestly, it's just an educational project.

**Issues:**
- Currently, the entire chat history is downloaded from the server, which can cause performance issues if there are a lot of messages.
- Channels are not working (well, this isn't really an issue; the channel system just hasn't been implemented yet, lol).
- The client wasn't designed with *responsiveness* in mind, so it doesn't work well on small devices.
